<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation</h1>
This setup involves downloading the osTicket installation files, configuring IIS with CGI, installing PHP and required modules, setting up MySQL, and registering PHP in IIS before installing osTicket v1.15.8. After installation, IIS is reloaded, necessary PHP extensions are enabled, and the osTicket configuration file is renamed and assigned proper permissions. Finally, HeidiSQL is used to create a new database for osTicket, and the installation is completed through the web browser..<br />

In this step, IIS (Internet Information Services), which is Windows' built-in web server, is installed and configured with CGI (Common Gateway Interface) to enable support for executing PHP scripts. Since IIS does not natively process PHP, enabling CGI (specifically FastCGI) allows IIS to interpret and run PHP-based applications like osTicket, ensuring proper communication between the web server and the PHP interpreter.

When you open IIS as an administrator and register PHP, you’re configuring IIS to handle and process PHP files, as IIS does not support PHP natively. By running IIS with administrative privileges, you ensure you have the necessary access to modify server settings. Registering PHP involves associating the .php file extension with the appropriate handler, typically FastCGI, which allows IIS to pass PHP requests to the PHP interpreter for execution. This step enables IIS to process dynamic content generated by PHP scripts and ensures applications like osTicket, which rely on PHP, can run smoothly on the server. It also optimizes performance by maintaining the PHP process in memory, reducing overhead and improving response times for user requests.

When you install HeidiSQL and create a new database called “osTicket”, you're setting up a powerful database management tool that provides a graphical interface to easily interact with MySQL or MariaDB databases. After installation, you connect HeidiSQL to your database server, providing it with the necessary credentials (server address, username, password) to access the server. Once connected, you create a new database specifically for osTicket, which will house all its data such as user information, tickets, system settings, and logs. This process is essential for osTicket to function properly, as the system relies on this dedicated database to store, retrieve, and manage all the data that powers the ticketing operations. Creating this database ensures that osTicket has a clean and organized storage structure to handle requests and maintain smooth operations.
