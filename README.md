When installing osTicket on Windows, you need a web server to handle requests. Windows comes with IIS (Internet Information Services), which is a built-in web server used for hosting websites and applications. However, since IIS does not natively support PHP, we need to enable CGI (Common Gateway Interface) to allow IIS to execute PHP scripts. Since osTicket is a PHP-based ticketing system, it cannot run directly on IIS without an interpreter. The CGI module (specifically FastCGI in modern versions of IIS) enables PHP scripts to execute efficiently. PHP in the other hand is a server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web applications. osTicket is built using PHP, meaning IIS needs a way to execute PHP scripts when users interact with the system.

When you open IIS as an administrator and register PHP, you’re configuring IIS to handle and process PHP files, as IIS does not support PHP natively. By running IIS with administrative privileges, you ensure you have the necessary access to modify server settings. Registering PHP involves associating the .php file extension with the appropriate handler, typically FastCGI, which allows IIS to pass PHP requests to the PHP interpreter for execution. This step enables IIS to process dynamic content generated by PHP scripts and ensures applications like osTicket, which rely on PHP, can run smoothly on the server. It also optimizes performance by maintaining the PHP process in memory, reducing overhead and improving response times for user requests.

<h2>Install HeidiSQL and create a new database called osTicket</h2>

</p>
<p>
When you install HeidiSQL and create a new database called “osTicket”, you're setting up a powerful database management tool that provides a graphical interface to easily interact with MySQL or MariaDB databases. After installation, you connect HeidiSQL to your database server, providing it with the necessary credentials (server address, username, password) to access the server. Once connected, you create a new database specifically for osTicket, which will house all its data such as user information, tickets, system settings, and logs. This process is essential for osTicket to function properly, as the system relies on this dedicated database to store, retrieve, and manage all the data that powers the ticketing operations. Creating this database ensures that osTicket has a clean and organized storage structure to handle requests and maintain smooth operations.
